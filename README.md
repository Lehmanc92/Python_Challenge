Analysis of Banking and Polling Data

PyBank-
  This script imports a profit/loss statement covering several years of results (counting by each month) as a .csv file.  It then compiles the total number of months, the total profit/loss, the average change within each month, and reports the months (and their respective amounts) with the greatest increase and decrease in profits.  Finally, the summary is printed within the terminal, and an output file is generated as a .txt file.
  
PyPoll-
   This script imports election data (a .csv file) with voter ID number, county, and for whom they voted. It generates the total vote count, lists of each individual candidate, their respective number of votes, and the candidates' percentage of the total vote.  The script also evaluates which candidate received the most votes and declares the winner.    Finally, the summary is printed within the terminal, and an output file is generated as a .txt file.
